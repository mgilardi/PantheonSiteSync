Test ready for Q.A.: 
    Updated from Dev.
    Merged data from Live.
    Did a comparative random sampling of pages between Live and Test.
    Looked for and if found checked maps and directory listings.

Live Updated
    Backed up live
    Pushed test to live.
    Checked a couple of random pages to make sure they looked the same.

    Looked for pages that would use ASU DIR (see issue CHS-235) but didn't see any so didn't add hot-fix in push to Live server.
    Moved hot-fix (see issue CHS-235) to Test server.
