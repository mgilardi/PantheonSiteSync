TO DO
=====
    The timing works in terms of lapsed time but it's about 7 hours off for the
    start and end time suggesting it's using UTC instead of local time, fix it.

INITIALIZING
============
    If you wish to change your scripts' root directory folder name either:
      a) Change this line in every file it occurs:
            PANTHEON_DOWNLOAD_AUTOMATION_SCRIPT_ROOT_DIR=automation
      b) Add the line:
            export PANTHEON_DOWNLOAD_AUTOMATION_SCRIPT_ROOT_DIR=<YOUR SCRIPT ROOT FOLDER NAME>
         to your's and the root user's .profile file.

    You should make ./drupal/data/tokens_to_restore_db empty. Your usage will
    populate it with your data.

    ide dir - This is empty but if you wish to automate some of your ide's setup
              add the code here and call it from the install.sh file.

REQUIREMENTS
============
    rsync
    -----
        rsync must be version 3.1+. It is on brew.

        You will need an ssh key for the root user for the rsync operation. 
        You do this with:
            sudo bash -i
            mkdir .ssh
            cd .ssh
            ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
            Copy your new rsa.pub file to Pantheon

    CUSTOMIZATION
    -------------
        Customize the files in the config dir. to your needs.

    gsed 
    ----
        You need it, get it from brew.

    tree
    ----
        You need it, get it from brew. Alternatively, replace it with the 
        reporting of your liking.

    mysql_config_editor
    -------------------
        If your mysql is older you might not have this, update mysql or alter 
        the code to not need it.

    apache
    ------
        This uses apache 2.4 from brew. If you have a different web server
        write your own scripts for your web server and then include the script
        in the install.sh file and of course exclude apache. This way we build 
        up a library of web servers and people can just "plug in" the one they
        want.

        Even if you are using apache 2.4 from brew you will most probably have
        different paths for location of things. To handle this change the paths
        in: ./web-server/templates/* which you will want to match up with any
        patch changes you make in ./config/system.sh

    pv
    --
        You need it, get it from brew. Alternatively, replace it with the 
        reporting of your liking.

USAGE
=====
    ./install.sh
    ------------
        Put automation as a sibling folder to your other projects.
        cd to it.
        sudo in it.
        run: ./install.sh <folder name for desired project>

    ./drupal/drupal_setup.sh
    ------------------------
        Some components (eventually all hopefully) can be run independent of 
        ./install.sh. Primarily these are the DB commands to set and restore user 1
        in a drupal DB. You do this by running:
            ./drupal/drupal_setup.sh -f <FUNCTION> <PROJECT-QUERY>
            where:
                FUNCTION is the name of the function to call in drupal_setup.sh.
                These will almost certainly be on of:
                        set_local_user_one_pass
                    restore_local_user_one_pass
                       set_remote_user_one_pass
                   restore_remote_user_one_pass

                PROJECT-QUERY is the first few letters of the project's folder name,
                enough letters to determine which project is best but less will 
                still work ...you'll just have to make a decision when prompted with 
                options.

    ./git-merge-from-upstream.sh
    ----------------------------
        This is not really part of the automation. It's really just a convenience
        in case you are prone to forget the commands for merging upstream into 
        your local git repo. Usage:
            cd <DRUPAL ROOT DIRECTORY>
            run the file or just paste it's content on the command line.

workflow dir
============
    Throw in here anything that helps you with your work flow. This is not part 
    of the automation, just a placeholder for things you may use repeatedly in
    your work flow.

remove_cmds.sh
==============
    The file ./remove/remove_cmds.sh is not meant to be run. It is instead a 
    reminder of all the things touched by the install script and you should use
    it as a guide to everything to check and modify if you wish to remove an 
    install.
